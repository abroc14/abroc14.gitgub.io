            <h3>Explaining block chain to my mom <small>9/12/2024</small></h3>
            <p>Blockchain is a very complicated concept. So as the name implies it is a chain of blocks. A single block contains a unique ID, a timestamp, some sort of data, a nonce, and a hash. Everything in that block is “summarized” by something called a hash. The hash is a very complicated code that is unique to that block and all of the data it contains, meaning no block can have the same hash. The way these blocks are connected to make a chain is also by their hash. It is like a very complicated puzzle that you don’t have the correct pieces to. Now that you understand a hash, the way you generate this hash is through something called a nonce. The nonce is like the final piece of the puzzle. So, being the final piece of this puzzle the nonce is a random number that is very hard to figure out. The hash of the current block has a predetermined number of zeros. So, you have to find the correct nonce that makes the hash for that block have the correct number of zeros. The nonce is like the final piece of information needed that gives the correct summary of the block, but it is unknown. Once that correct nonce is found, the block is complete and the process starts over.</p>
            <p2>Blockchain is used as a public ledger to keep transactions in chronological order. The data in the blocks is transactions. So, anyone can download this ledger and have access to every transaction that has ever been made on this chain. Since everyone has access to this ledger everyone has a copy of it, so no one can change anything that has already been done. This makes it immutable, meaning it will never be able to be edited or changed in anyway. The only way a change can be made is to correct it in the future. Since it is immutable, it keeps everyone honest.</p2>
